# WWDC2023
 
 
The concept of "High Blue" has been with me since my youth. I was fascinated by the way the autumn sky appeared to be both higher and bluer than during other seasons. My curiosity led me to research the science behind this phenomenon, including the effects of sunlight scattering and air density on the sky's appearance. When I decided to develop an app for a student challenge, I knew I wanted to create something that was both simple and educational. This reminded me of my youthful curiosity, and I realized that most people have likely pondered the same question at some point in their lives. However, few have explored the science behind it. My goal was to create an app that would enable people to learn about this natural phenomenon easily and directly. In addition to educating users, I wanted to encourage them to look at the sky with fresh eyes. The sky is one of nature's greatest wonders, and I believe that learning about it can inspire a sense of awe and wonder.
